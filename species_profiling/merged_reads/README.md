# Metaphlam community analyses, biological replicates

Concatenated biological replicate files, see previous directory structure for info about `/profiles/` 

Files:

- `*R1/R2.concat*`: Split R1 and R2 files, merged by biological replicate
- `*bothreads_concat*`: Concatenated R1 and R2 into a single file for each bio rep
- `Metaphlam.sh`: script to run metaphlam on bio replicates
- `Humann.sh`: script to classify each sequence into gene clusters. Given up because I don't want to download 15gb database 

Directories:

- `profiles`: metaplam outputs of bio replicates
